WEATHER DASHBOARD-Sarah Wist

The task set to our class was for each of us to create a weather dashboard that implemented several of the key concepts we have learned over the past week.  Our dashboard needed to utilize an API Key from Open Weather to pull weather data from cities around the world.  

The dashboard had several functions.  The main four were displaying the current weather in any city, displaying the UV Index of the selected city, displaying the five day forecast of the same city, and storing the data of a previously searched city.

The current weather data for a city displayed the temperature, wind speed, and humidity.  The UV Index displayed a UV number that was color-coded by category to indicate if the index was at a favorable, moderate, or severe level.  The five day forecast displayed the temperature and humidity.

It is important for a user to be able to save this data because the searched city may be the residence of the user or a city the user visits often.  In addition, a user may need this stored data to track the long term weather and climate of any given city.  

Being able to call and store all of this data required different queryURLS to pull the current and five day forecast as well as the UV Index.  Also, local storage functions are needed for the click events to store the data of a city this is input into the search box.
